# 8_Week_SQL_Challenge
This repository presents my solutions for the #8WeekSQLChallenge, containing eight distinct case studies that thoroughly demonstrate my SQL skills. 
Throughout these case studies, I tackle a broad range of SQL challenges, showcasing my expertise in areas such as ranking queries, using common table
expressions (CTEs), working with datetime functions, handling text data, performing aggregations, and managing NULL values. Each solution emphasizes my
ability to compose effective queries and approach complex problems methodically, reflecting a strong foundation in SQL and a commitment to mastering diverse data scenarios.
